The full day workshop schedule is planned with two half-day sessions that will be split by the conference planned lunch break.

Note that our tentative schedule currently has this planned for 12:00-13:00, but we will update accordingly once provided further guidance as to the standardized workshop schedule for IV'25.

Our program will consist of the following main components: 1) invited keynotes from experts in the field coming from both industry and academia to create a synergistic atmosphere and to stimulate collaborations, 2) contributed research oral talks selected from the set of accepted works into DLIVA, 3) future directions panel discussion that will be composed of our keynote speakers given their expertise in this domain, 4) contributed poster sessions to allow all those with works accepted into the workshop (not just those selected for oral talks) to present their work and socialize stimulating new ideas and potential collaborations.

**Panel.** 
Our anticipation is to have two panel discussions in our workshop. 
The panelists will be a subset of our keynote speakers and organizers and will focus on the future directions in the area of intelligent vehicles. 
We believe this is the most fitting formal final component of the workshop and hope that it will help stimulate conversions at the end of the keynote presentations.

#### Selection Process 

The invited keynote speakers from both academia and industry are planned to be well recognized in the IV community. 
We note that each keynote will be presented as a lecture with slides and there will be a short Q/A session at the end of each keynote.

This workshop CFP is for paper submissions that will undergo the standard single-blind peer-review process. 
We will guarantee each paper submission will be reviewed by at least two PC members to ensure an informed and fair evaluation of the work being submitted. 
Based upon the reviews provided by PC members, the final recommendation of acceptance or rejection to DLIVA at IV'25 will be made by the associate editors.

The detailed review comments and notification letter will be sent to the authors accordingly along with detailed information as to whether they have been accepted for an oral or poster presentation (as noted above in the tentative workshop schedule).
