**[Holger Caesar](https://it-caesar.de/)** is a tenured Assistant Professor in the Intelligent Vehicles group of TU Delft in the Netherlands. 
Holger’s research interests are in Autonomous Vehicle perception and prediction, with a particular focus on the scalability of learning and annotation approaches. 
Previously, Holger was a Principal Research Scientist at an autonomous vehicle company called Motional (formerly nuTonomy). 
He started three teams with 20+ members that focused on Data Annotation, Autolabeling, and Data Mining. 
Holger received a PhD in Computer Vision from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland under Prof. Dr. Vittorio Ferrari and studied in Germany and Switzerland (KIT Karlsruhe, EPF Lausanne, ETH Zurich). 
He is best known for developing the influential autonomous driving datasets nuScenes and nuPlan and his contributions to the real-time 3D object detection method PointPillars. 
His research interests include 3D detection, segmentation, prediction, active learning, sensor fusion, and collaborative perception. 
Holger has an extensive record of publications in top-tier conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and IEEE IV, and he has secured multiple grants, including an EU KDT grant and a TU Delft internal grant. 
Holger also serves as an Associate Editor for IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) and holds several roles at TU Delft, and is a board member of the ELLIS Delft unit. 
He was the area chair at ICCV’23, NCCV’23, and ECCV’24 and will be the area chair for CVPR 2025. 
Holger has contributed to 32 workshops as an organizer or keynote speaker. 
He co-organized 13 workshops (COCO@ICCV’17, COCO@ICCV’19, WAD@CVPR’19, AIDO@NeurIPS’19, BPAD@IROS’20, AIDO@NeurIPS’20, AIDO@ICRA’21, SRAD@ICRA’23, E2E-AD@CVPR’23, DMLR@ICLR’24, FMAS@CVPR’24, CODA@ECCV’24), DriveX@CVPR'25, one conference (NCCV’23), and gave 19 keynote presentations.
